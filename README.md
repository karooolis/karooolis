## Full-stack software engineer

My name is Karolis Ramanauskas ðŸ‘‹ I'm a full-stack software engineer who enjoys building products. I've worked at small start-ups, as well as big companies such as Uber and Volvo Cars. I'm always on the lookout for more efficient ways to ship reliable software. You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/karooolis) or [visit my personal site](https://krl.is/).

<strong>I work/worked with: </strong>JavaScript/TypeScript, React/Next.js, Node.js, Solidity, GraphQL, Docker, and a little bit of everything else...
