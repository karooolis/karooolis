## Software Engineer & Smart Contracts Auditor 

I am a full-stack software engineer turned smart contracts auditor. I've worked at companies like Uber, Toptal and Volvo Cars. I've also built my own side-projects, most of which are now are defunct, or have been sold.

For the last year I've turned my focus to work in the Web3 space, and am honing my skills as a smart contracts auditor.

<strong>I work/worked with:</strong> Solidity, JavaScript/TypeScript, ReactJS, SQL, Redis, MongoDB, Docker, a little bit of everything else...
